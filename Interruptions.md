How to mitigate and reduce interruptions
========================================
Strategies to maximize your time to focus.


Understand your own priorities
------------------------------

Our daily activities can often be classified along two axis:
1. Important vs. non-important
2. Urgent vs. non-urgent

Most of your day will likely consist of important tasks, presumably starting with the urgent ones and then moving on to the non-urgent ones.  Being aware of where tasks fall can help establish the context necessary when unexpected demands of your time are requested and should also help you plan your day.


Plan your day
-------------

As insinuated in the previous section, you may want to plan your day such that you can organize your activities for your most productive times and around any fixed blocks of time (such as meetings or other activities).  Make a schedule, however preliminary, as a starting point.  Start with the urgent and important tasks, allocating extra time for surprises and potential interruptions.


Establish a culture of focus
----------------------------

TODO: indicators, explicit (status) and implicit (headphones, door)
TODO: self-sufficiency, searching knowledge base, online, using tools appropriately

### Communication media, ranked
This may vary by organization, culture and resources, but the general idea remains the same: determine how people can reach you depending on the urgency and/or importance of the situation.

| Turnaround time  | Medium                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| With a day or 2  | Knowledge base                |
| With a day       | E-mail                        |
| Within 2-3 hours | Group chat                    |
| Within an hour   | Direct/instant message        |
| Within a minute  | Phone call or in-person visit |


An interruption happens
-----------------------

Now that you understand your priorities, have planned your day and started on your tasks, someone wants your attention.  Don't panic!
