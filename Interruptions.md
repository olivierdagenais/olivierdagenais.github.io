How to mitigate and reduce interruptions
========================================

Strategies to maximize your time to focus.

Understand your own priorities
------------------------------

Our daily activities can often be classified along two axis:

1. Important vs. non-important
2. Urgent vs. non-urgent

Most of your day will likely consist of important tasks, presumably starting with the urgent ones and then moving on to the non-urgent ones.  Being aware of where tasks fall can help establish the context necessary when unexpected demands of your time are requested and should also help you plan your day.

Plan your day
-------------

As insinuated in the previous section, you may want to plan your day such that you can organize your activities for your most productive times and around any fixed blocks of time (such as meetings or other activities).  Make a schedule, however preliminary, as a starting point.  Start with the urgent and important tasks, allocating extra time for surprises and potential interruptions.

Establish a culture of focus
----------------------------

This is probably the hardest part:  convincing friends, family and/or colleagues that long stretches of uninterrupted time provide the ideal conditions for getting great work done, whereas interruptions involve costly context-switching.

### Indicate your status

One way of establishing figurative boundaries might be as simple as setting your status as busy or do-not-disturb in your chat client, or blocking off time in your calendar.

As for the real world, assuming you don't have a door or [one of those orbs that light up automatically](https://www.busylight.com/en/about), one idea is to use the presence/absence of headphones as an indicator of being in the zone.  Another idea a colleague once told me about was hanging a "gone fishing" poster when they needed to concentrate and avoid interruptions.

### Teach resourcefulness

One skill you might have to teach others is resourcefulness: the ability to get unstuck by yourself, also known as "teaching how to fish".

Whether it is by suggesting web search keywords, recommending books or encouraging techniques such as [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) (which also works without a duck; the very act of composing an e-mail might result in the answer being discovered before finishing the e-mail), there are plenty of opportunities to lead someone through an answer rather than just giving it to them.  Yes, this takes more time and effort, but think of it as an investment.  You might have to suggest [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).

### Prioritize the available communication media

This may vary by organization, culture and resources, but the general idea remains the same: determine how people can and should reach each other depending on the urgency and/or importance of the situation.  Here's an example ranking based on turnaround time:

| Turnaround time   | Medium                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Within a day or 2 | Knowledge base                |
| Within a day      | E-mail                        |
| Within 2-3 hours  | Group chat                    |
| Within an hour    | Direct/instant message        |
| Within a minute   | Phone call or in-person visit |

Respond to an interruption
--------------------------

Now that you understand your priorities, have planned your day and started on your tasks, someone wants your attention.  Don't panic!

### Respond assertively

There's a spectrum of possible responses.  We all know what an aggressive response might look like (hint: it might be followed by a visit from your manager or even HR) but did you know an inability to say "no" is at the other end of the spectrum?  Somewhere between aggressive and passive responses lies a third type of response: an assertive one.  It's neither an automatic/definitive "no" nor "yes", but rather about answering a question:  when is the best time for us to work together?

### Understand each other's priorities

State what you're working on & when it's due and then ask about what they need your help with and by when.  Context matters!  Both parties must understand the relative impact and business value of each task. A good way to help gauge this is by establishing who the stakeholders are in both situations.

### Think Win-Win

The best take on assertive responses I've learned about was from [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) (you might be interested in this [7-minute Animated Book Review on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy8XE5h8qGM)), where every interaction is an opportunity for both parties to benefit.

In that paradigm, an aggressive response to a request would be considered Win-Lose; the responder "Wins" by not being interrupted but the requester "Loses" by not getting help.  Conversely, a passive response is Lose-Win, with the roles reversed.  In both cases, someone loses and neither situation is good in the long term.  This is where an assertive response comes in: it's about Win-Win and thus each party looks for a way to help the other to maximize the potential value of the interaction.

### Example

This is what an assertive response that tries to understand priorities and is framed in terms of win-win might look like:
> "I am working on this report that's due to X by 15:00.  Let me understand what you need so we can find the best time for us to work together."

The requester can then explain what they need, who it's for and by when such that the conversation can be steered toward what's more important to complete first and when the best time to collaborate is, keeping in mind that the requester (continuing with the example) might be able to help complete the report that's due at 15:00.
