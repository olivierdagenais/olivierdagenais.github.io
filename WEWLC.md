Working Effectively With Legacy Code
====================================
A book summary by Olivier Dagenais

Preface
-------
> (p. xv) "[The teams] are trying very hard, but at the end of the day, because of schedule pressure, __the weight of history__, or a lack of any better code to comapre their efforts to, many people are writing legacy code."

> (p. xvi) "To me, legacy code is simply code without tests."

> (p. xvi) "Code without tests is bad code. It doesn't matter how well written it is; it doesn't matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is.  With tests, we can change the behaviour of our code quickly and verifiably.  Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better or worse."
